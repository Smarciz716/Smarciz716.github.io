      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="justified">I create content that drives outcomesâ€”proposals that win contracts, documentation that actually gets used, and internal processes that make teams more effective. Whether Iâ€™m aligning with compliance frameworks, translating technical solutions for evaluators, or building scalable systems from scratch, I bring clarity, structure, and strategy to every deliverable.</p>
      <p class="justified">Over the past 20+ years, Iâ€™ve supported fast-paced environments across SaaS, cybersecurity, government, education, and more. Iâ€™ve led complex proposals on tight timelines, developed documentation systems for continuous-release software teams, and written policies that stood up to the strictest audits. My work spans technical writing, business operations, policy development, and cross-functional collaborationâ€”each piece tailored to its audience and grounded in impact.</p>
